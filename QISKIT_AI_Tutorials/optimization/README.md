# QISKit ACQUA Optimization Tutorials, Samples and Input Files

QISKit ACQUA Optimization is a set of tools, algorithms and software for use with quantum computers to 
carry out research and investigate how to take advantage of quantum computing power to solve optimization
problems. 

QISKit ACQUA Optimization translates optimization-specific problems into inputs
for a quantum algorithm residing in QISKit ACQUA, which in turn uses [QISKit](https://www.qiskit.org/) for the relevant
quantum computation. 

This folder contains some Jupyter Notebook examples. There are Python code files too.

For more detail see the main [index](../index.ipynb#optimization)

## Input files

The folder [input_files](input_files) contains a number of example JSON input files that can be loaded 
and run by the QISKit ACQUA [GUI](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-acqua/README.md#gui) or by the QISKit ACQUA
[command line](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-acqua/README.md#command-line) tool.
