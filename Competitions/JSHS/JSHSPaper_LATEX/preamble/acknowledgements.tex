\begin{abstract}
I would like to thank Duke Writer from the Academy of Science for his generous support throughout the duration of this research endeavor. He has been with me since the beginning of this project and has helped me overcome many obstacles. Throughout this process, he introduced me to the importance of research in computer science and truly conveyed the meaning of inquiry. I would also like to thank Dr. Matt Weber from UC Berkeley for enhancing my understanding of theoretical computer science. He helped refine my project from simply experimental data to theoretical application. He helped me expand the breath of my project so that it could reach a whole new audience.
